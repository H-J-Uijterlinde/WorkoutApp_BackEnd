# WorkoutApp_BackEnd
This Repository contains the source code for a the back-end of a workout app I created. 
It uses Spring and Hibernate to persist muscles, exercises, users, workouts etc. to a database, 
and set up a RESTfull API to be consumed by GUI applications.

After cloning the source code and providing database credentials in the src/main/resources/jdbc.properties file, the application
is booted by using the Gradle bootRun command.
